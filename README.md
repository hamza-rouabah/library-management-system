# Books Inventory Management System
The books inventory management system is a desktop
application designed to manage and organize a library’s collection of
books. Utilizing object-oriented concepts to lay the foundation of the
application’s development, the system’s main objective is to provide
an efficient and an easy-to-use solution for librarians and bookshops
to track their inventory.
